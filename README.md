**RAI (Revolt AI Agent)** is a modern, YAML-driven CLI tool and framework for building intelligent agents and agent teams tailored for cybersecurity automation, offensive security, and penetration testing operations.
Built on top of the powerful [Agno framework](https://docs.agno.com), RAI enables security professionals, red teamers, and AI hackers to design, orchestrate, and deploy advanced LLM-powered agents without writing traditional code. Its no-code architecture leverages structured YAML configurations to define agent behavior, tools, and team collaboration logic.



### Features🔧:

- 🧠 **Interactive Shell Mode** – Engage in real-time conversations with LLM agents and teams via a powerful interactive CLI. Seamlessly switch between agents or teams with intuitive commands.
  
- 📝 **YAML-Based Agent & Team Building** – Define agents and teams using easy-to-edit YAML templates. Accelerate development with low-code configurations and smart defaults.
  
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent & Team Support** – Build, run, and manage multiple agents or teams in parallel with full operational isolation and coordination.
  
- 🔌 **Tool Integration (SSE & stdio)** – Integrate custom tools via Server-Sent Events or standard I/O for dynamic agent-tool communication.
  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Team Allocation** – Flexibly assign, reassign, or reconfigure agents across different teams at runtime to optimize task workflows.
  
- 🧩 **MCP-Compatible Infrastructure** – Built with modularity in mind, RAI is ready for integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tooling and future agent standards.
  
- ⚙️ **Fast & Flexible Configuration** – Lightweight setup with extensible configuration options. Designed for developers who want control without the clutter.
  
- 🧠 **Built-In Reasoning Engine** – Agents can *think*, *reason*, and *decide* intelligently before taking action, enabling smarter task execution.
  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity-First Design** – Purpose-built for red teaming, bug bounty automation, recon, exploit development, and offensive security workflows.
  
- 🧬 **Agent-to-Agent Communication** – Enable inter-agent messaging within teams, allowing agents to delegate tasks, collaborate, and share results autonomously.

### 🚀 Future Enhancement Plan:

RAI (Revolt AI Agent) is under **continuous development** 🛠️ — evolving rapidly to empower cybersecurity automation with intelligent, collaborative agents. Upcoming features include:

- 📚 **Agent & Team Knowledge Injection**  
  Allow agents and teams to use **custom knowledge bases**, enabling them to:
  - Ingest structured/unstructured data sources (e.g., markdown, PDFs, JSON, code)  
  - Improve reasoning and task performance through embedded knowledge  
  - Learn iteratively and adapt during operations

- 🧩 **Agent Knowledge Learning Loop**  
  Equip agents with mechanisms to analyze outcomes, refine their behavior, and build contextual awareness from completed tasks.
