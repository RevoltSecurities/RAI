**RAI (Revolt AI Agent)** is a modern, YAML-driven CLI tool and framework for building intelligent agents and agent teams tailored for cybersecurity automation, offensive security, and penetration testing operations.
Built on top of the powerful [Agno framework](https://docs.agno.com), RAI enables security professionals, red teamers, and AI hackers to design, orchestrate, and deploy advanced LLM-powered agents without writing traditional code. Its no-code architecture leverages structured YAML configurations to define agent behavior, tools, and team collaboration logic.

# 🛠 YAML Configuration

RAI allows you to define **AI Agents** and **Agent Teams** using a simple YAML configuration. This configuration determines how agents behave, what models they use, what tools are attached, and how they collaborate as teams.

---

## ✳️ Agent Configuration (`agents`)

Each agent must define the following **required fields**:

| Field         | Type     | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`        | string   | Unique agent name, must use `-` or `_` only (e.g., `web_pentest_agent`) |
| `model`       | string   | The provider name (e.g., `openai`, `gemini`, `groq`, `xai`) |
| `model-id`    | string   | The specific model ID to use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gemini-2.0-pro`) |
| `apikey`      | string   | API key for the chosen provider  |
| `role`        | string   | A short sentence describing the agent’s purpose |
| `description` | string   | Multi-line detailed description of the agent’s capabilities |
| `instructions`| string   | A clear set of multi-line operational guidelines for the agent |
| `tools`       | toolconfig     | Tools assigned to the agent (`sse` or `stdio` types with required params) |


> ✅ The only **optional field** is `think: true`, which enables your agent to think and analyze before its response

---

## 🧠 Team Configuration (`teams`)

Teams are collaborative groups of agents that share analysis tasks.

Each team must define the following **required fields**:

| Field         | Type     | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`        | string   | Team name, must use `-` or `_` only (e.g., `pentest_team`) |
| `mode`        | string   | Team mode (e.g., `coordinate`, `route`, `collaborate`) |
| `model`       | string   | Provider name for internal logic (same as in agents) |
| `model-id`    | string   | Model ID used for internal processing |
| `apikey`      | string   | API key for the team’s model |
| `instructions`| string   | Multi-line instructions on how the team should collaborate |
| `members`     | list     | List of agent names (must match agent `name` fields) |
| `tools`       | toolconfig     | Tools assigned to the agent (`sse` or `stdio` types with required params) |
| `success_criteria` | string | Configure your teams collaboration success criteria to achieve your goal for the RAI Team task

> ✅ `think: true` is an **optional field** to allow team-wide reasoning before responding.

---

## 🧩 Agent Naming Convention

To ensure consistency and compatibility:

- Agent and team `name` fields must:
  - Be unique across agents and teams
  - Use only lowercase characters, numbers, `-`, or `_`
  - Not contain spaces or special characters

✅ **Valid:** `api_pentest_agent`, `web-agent-1`  
❌ **Invalid:** `Agent 01`, `Web*Pentest`

---

## 🔗 Team Member Allocation Rules

- `members` must list agent names **already defined** under the `agents:` section.
- All member agents **must be valid and fully configured** before referencing them in a team.
- Duplicate agent names or undeclared agents will raise errors.

---

### 🔧 Tools Configuration

Agents or Teams can integrate external or internal MCP tools via yaml configuration:

#### SSE Tool (Server-Sent Events)
```yaml
- type: "sse"
  name: "tool_name"
  params:
    url: "http://host:port/endpoint"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer your_token_here"
```

#### Stdio Tool (Local MCP server execution)
```yaml
- type: "stdio"
  name: "tool_name"
  params:
    command: "command_to_run (ex:uv)"
    args: ["arg1", "arg2", "argN"]
```

### 🚀 Future Enhancement Plan:

RAI (Revolt AI Agent) is under **continuous development** 🛠️ — evolving rapidly to empower cybersecurity automation with intelligent, collaborative agents. Upcoming features include:

- 🖥 **Agent UI with Agno UI Integration**  
  A powerful web-based UI to manage, monitor, and interact with agents, tools, and teams visually — built on Agno's robust interface layer.

- 🧠 **Memory & Session Storage Management**  
  Agents will support persistent session memory:
  - Maintain conversation continuity  
  - Recall user preferences, task history, and learned context

- 📚 **Agent & Team Knowledge Injection**  
  Allow agents and teams to use **custom knowledge bases**, enabling them to:
  - Ingest structured/unstructured data sources (e.g., markdown, PDFs, JSON, code)  
  - Improve reasoning and task performance through embedded knowledge  
  - Learn iteratively and adapt during operations

- 🧩 **Agent Knowledge Learning Loop**  
  Equip agents with mechanisms to analyze outcomes, refine their behavior, and build contextual awareness from completed tasks.
