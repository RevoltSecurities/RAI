</h1>

- **Interactive Shell Mode** - RAI developed with advance shell interface that allows user to switch between built LLM Teams and LLM Agents and start conversation with selected agents/teams
- **Low-Code YAML-Based Agent & Team Building** ‚Äì Automate complex LLM agent/team setups with easy-to-edit YAML templates.  
- **Multiple Agent & Team Support** ‚Äì Build, manage, and run multiple agents or teams in parallel with full isolation.  
- **Tool Integration (SSE & stdio)** ‚Äì Seamlessly plug in tools using Server-Sent Events or standard I/O for real-time interaction.  
- **Dynamic Team Allocation** ‚Äì Assign and reconfigure agents across teams dynamically.

# üõ† YAML Configuration

RAI allows you to define **AI Agents** and **Agent Teams** using a simple YAML configuration. This configuration determines how agents behave, what models they use, what tools are attached, and how they collaborate as teams.

---

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Agent Configuration (`agents`)

Each agent must define the following **required fields**:

| Field         | Type     | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`        | string   | Unique agent name, must use `-` or `_` only (e.g., `web_pentest_agent`) |
| `model`       | string   | The provider name (e.g., `openai`, `gemini`, `groq`, `xai`) |
| `model-id`    | string   | The specific model ID to use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gemini-2.0-pro`) |
| `apikey`      | string   | API key for the chosen provider  |
| `role`        | string   | A short sentence describing the agent‚Äôs purpose |
| `description` | string   | Multi-line detailed description of the agent‚Äôs capabilities |
| `instructions`| string   | A clear set of multi-line operational guidelines for the agent |
| `tools`       | toolconfig     | Tools assigned to the agent (`sse` or `stdio` types with required params) |


> ‚úÖ The only **optional field** is `think: true`, which enables your agent to think and analyze before its response

---

## üß† Team Configuration (`teams`)

Teams are collaborative groups of agents that share analysis tasks.

Each team must define the following **required fields**:

| Field         | Type     | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`        | string   | Team name, must use `-` or `_` only (e.g., `pentest_team`) |
| `mode`        | string   | Team mode (e.g., `coordinate`, `route`, `collaborate`) |
| `model`       | string   | Provider name for internal logic (same as in agents) |
| `model-id`    | string   | Model ID used for internal processing |
| `apikey`      | string   | API key for the team‚Äôs model |
| `instructions`| string   | Multi-line instructions on how the team should collaborate |
| `members`     | list     | List of agent names (must match agent `name` fields) |
| `tools`       | toolconfig     | Tools assigned to the agent (`sse` or `stdio` types with required params) |
| `success_criteria` | string | Configure your teams collaboration success criteria to achieve your goal for the RAI Team task

> ‚úÖ `think: true` is an **optional field** to allow team-wide reasoning before responding.

---

## üß© Agent Naming Convention

To ensure consistency and compatibility:

- Agent and team `name` fields must:
  - Be unique across agents and teams
  - Use only lowercase characters, numbers, `-`, or `_`
  - Not contain spaces or special characters

‚úÖ **Valid:** `api_pentest_agent`, `web-agent-1`  
‚ùå **Invalid:** `Agent 01`, `Web*Pentest`

---

## üîó Team Member Allocation Rules

- `members` must list agent names **already defined** under the `agents:` section.
- All member agents **must be valid and fully configured** before referencing them in a team.
- Duplicate agent names or undeclared agents will raise errors.

---

### üîß Tools Configuration

Agents or Teams can integrate external or internal MCP tools via yaml configuration:

#### SSE Tool (Server-Sent Events)
```yaml
- type: "sse"
  name: "tool_name"
  params:
    url: "http://host:port/endpoint"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer your_token_here"
```

#### Stdio Tool (Local MCP server execution)
```yaml
- type: "stdio"
  name: "tool_name"
  params:
    command: "command_to_run (ex:uv)"
    args: ["arg1", "arg2", "argN"]
```
